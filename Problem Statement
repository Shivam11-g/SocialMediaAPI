Social media applications have huge users who always keep posting their thoughts, Images, and media. To manage a social media application, a huge need for resources and multiple copies of application deployments are needed. Social media applications should meet the requirement of High availability. While deploying the application and scaling up resources according to the requirement, we need to consider all the application dependencies and make sure that all dependencies for the application are available with respective versions. Since this is a Social-media application, usage of the application is not predictable. When users are increased our resources should be ready to scale up which is not possible with an on-premises setup until and unless you have huge resources. Even if you have resources it will take time for connecting those resources in a network and there are physical challenges that we need to face every day based on the usage of the application.
